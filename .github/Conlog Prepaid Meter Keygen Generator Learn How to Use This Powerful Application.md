Conlog is a leading provider of smart meters and metering solutions for utilities, municipalities, and property management companies in South Africa and other countries. Conlog prepaid meters use the Standard Transfer Specification (STS) protocol to enable secure and interoperable vending of electricity tokens.
 
One of the features of Conlog prepaid meters is the ability to change the meter key, which is a secret code that encrypts the tokens and prevents unauthorized access. The meter key can be changed by using a key change token, which is a special code that instructs the meter to accept a new key.

Key change tokens can be generated by using a software tool called KeyGen, which is provided by Conlog to authorized vendors and utilities. KeyGen can also be used to code and verify meter swipe cards, which are used to transfer tokens from vending machines to meters.
 
To generate a key change token, the user needs to enter the following information in KeyGen:
 
- The old meter key (16 hexadecimal digits)
- The new meter key (16 hexadecimal digits)
- The meter serial number (8 alphanumeric characters)
- The tariff index (2 decimal digits)
- The key revision number (2 decimal digits)
- The key type (STS4 or STS5)

After entering the required information, KeyGen will generate a 20-digit key change token, which can be printed or displayed on the screen. The user can then enter the token on the meter keypad or swipe card to change the meter key.
 
Changing the meter key is a security measure that can prevent fraud and tampering with prepaid meters. It is recommended to change the meter key periodically or whenever there is a suspicion of unauthorized access. However, changing the meter key should be done with caution, as it can also cause problems if done incorrectly or without proper authorization.

Conlog prepaid meters are designed to provide customers with convenience and control over their electricity consumption and expenditure. Customers can buy electricity tokens from various vending channels, such as online platforms, mobile apps, ATMs, kiosks, or shops. Customers can also monitor their usage and balance on the meter display or through SMS notifications.
 
Prepaid meters have several advantages for both customers and utilities. For customers, prepaid meters can help them save money by reducing wastage and encouraging energy efficiency. Prepaid meters can also eliminate the hassle of monthly bills, disconnections, reconnections, and estimated readings. For utilities, prepaid meters can improve cash flow, reduce operational costs, enhance customer service, and combat revenue losses due to theft and non-payment.
 
However, prepaid meters also have some challenges and limitations. For customers, prepaid meters can pose difficulties in accessing vending points, especially in remote or rural areas. Prepaid meters can also cause inconvenience or hardship in case of emergencies, power outages, or token errors. For utilities, prepaid meters can require significant upfront investment, maintenance, and security. Prepaid meters can also face resistance from some customers who prefer postpaid billing or who perceive prepaid meters as a form of discrimination or coercion.
