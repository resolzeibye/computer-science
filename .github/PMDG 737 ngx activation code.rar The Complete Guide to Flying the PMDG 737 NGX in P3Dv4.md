The PMDG 737 NGXu is not just a cosmetic update, but a complete overhaul of the simulation engine. The flight physics have been enhanced to provide more realistic handling and performance, and the wing and tail surfaces now have rigid body physics to simulate the effects of turbulence and gusts. The flight control systems have also been improved, with more accurate hydraulics, electric and pneumatic systems.
 
One of the most noticeable features of the PMDG 737 NGXu is the Electronic Flight Bag (EFB), which is a tablet device mounted on the left and right sides of the cockpit. The EFB can display various information and functions, such as performance calculations, charts, checklists, documents, options and failures. The EFB can also integrate with Navigraph, a subscription service that provides updated navigation data and charts for flight simulation.
 
The cockpit displays of the PMDG 737 NGXu have been upgraded to high resolution, with crisp and clear graphics and smooth animations. The displays can also show different equipment options, such as weather radar, terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS), traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) and vertical situation display (VSD). The cockpit also features new lighting effects, such as dynamic shadows and reflections.
 
The PMDG 737 NGXu comes with a variety of liveries and models to choose from, representing different airlines and configurations. The external models are made to an excellent standard, with high-resolution PBR textures that create realistic reflections and lighting effects. The models also feature enhanced animations, such as wing flex, spoilers, flaps, landing gear and doors. The winglets can be changed according to the real-world options available for each variant.
 
The sound suite of the PMDG 737 NGXu has been recorded on a fully instrumented test airplane, capturing every detail of the engine noise, cockpit sounds and environmental effects. The sound engine has been enhanced to create an immersive audio experience on the flight deck, with realistic spatial positioning and attenuation.
 
The PMDG 737 NGXu is compatible with PMDG Global Flight Operations (GFO), a new online service that will allow users to fly in a shared virtual airline environment with realistic schedules, dispatching, maintenance and crew management. GFO is expected to be launched in late 2020.

The PMDG 737 NGXu also features a drivable pushback tug, a new Operations Center 2.0 for managing updates and liveries, an expanded failures simulation that covers nearly all QRH scenarios, a native PMDG datalink simulation for offline flying and much more.
 
The PMDG 737 NGXu is a must-have for any serious flight simmer who wants to experience the ultimate 737 simulation. It is compatible only with Prepar3D v4.5+ & v5 and requires hardware flight controls. It can be purchased from the PMDG website for $99.99.
